# Sample solidity ERC20 Token Project

This project demonstrates a basic Solidity token contract. It comes with most of basic functionalities, that a token contract should have ranging from minting new tokens and burning the ones that have already been minted.

# Description 

This program is a simple token contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two  functions one for minting new tokens as mentioned above and another for burning new tokens it has a couple of public variables name, symbol, totalSupply, owner which represents the name, symbol totalSupply owner(the address responsible for the deployment of the contract) respectively, as well as a constructor which initializes these variables. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to ERC 20 token creation , and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects related to token creation in the future.

# Getting Started

to run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar then supply the necessary parameters which will be the token name, symbol totalSupply and then deploy.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint and burn function. you can also get the owner by clicking on the button that says owner as it was declared public.
